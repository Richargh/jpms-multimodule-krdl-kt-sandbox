= JPMS with Kotlin Sandbox

INFO: Sadly this implementation does not quite work.
It compiles and everything but only the `requires` directive from the `module-info` is actually enforced.
`exports` do not have to be declared and that makes this JPMS Sandbox currently rather useless :(

*Features*

* JVM 11
* Java Platform Module System (JPMS)
* Multiple Kotlin Modules

== Usage

* Build complete project `./gradlew build`
* Build individual project `./gradlew :component:shared-kernel:build`

== Troubleshoot

=== Class has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Environment

* Check that your gradle uses the right JVM version `./gradlew --version`
* In IntelliJ
** Check the gradle it uses: Settings->Build, Execution,...->Build Tools->Gradle->Gradle JVM
** Right click your project and open the Module Settings->Project->Project SDK

== JPMS

The Java Platform Module System (JPMS) is available since Java 9.
